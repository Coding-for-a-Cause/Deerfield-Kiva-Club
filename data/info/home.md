Kiva Club is a Microloans club at Deerfield High School run through the KIVA organization. We raise money and loan it out to entrepreneurs (many from undeveloped countries) allowing them to grow their businesses. Once they are in a position to pay us back, we get reimbursed by the website and get the opportunity to reinvest.  Feel free to check out the website for yourself at: <https://www.kiva.org/>.
